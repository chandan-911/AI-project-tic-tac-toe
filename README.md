1. Launch the game by running `runner.py`.
2. The game window will open, and you can start playing TicTacToe.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game against the AI.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- Numpy

## Notes

- This project was developed as part of an AI Lab assignment.
- Make sure all files are in the same directory for the game to function correctly.
